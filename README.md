# Checking If a Given Point Inside of 3 of Given Triangles

This project includes 1 flowchart and 1 .c file. Our purpose on this project take 9 point those are on xy coordinate system and check if they can form 3 triangles. If they can, take another point from user and check if this point present on any of this triangle's area. 

## Flowchart Legend:
Flowchart's operators exactly have the same meanings as python operators except 1 operator. In that flowchart f strings as same as python but I used the curly bracets "{}" as a formatting operator in variables. So if you see {x} in a variable then there will be x's values instead of '{x}'(ex. for c2 = 1 then Variable{c2} = Variable1 )
